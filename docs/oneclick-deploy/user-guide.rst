Introduction
============

This user guide describes how to deploy Acumos platforms using the
"One Click deploy" tools designed for those who want a simple and automated way
to deploy an Acumos platform.

What is an AIO deploy?
----------------------

By default, the AIO deploy tools build an all-in-one instance of Acumos, with
all Acumos data and components running under docker or kubernetes (k8s) on a
single virtual machine or physical host machine.

For k8s based deployments, both generic (standard k8s project tools) and
OpenShift (RedHat's k8s distribution) are supported.

Options allow the user to deploy the platform:

* on a cluster of k8s nodes (note: distributing specific components across nodes
  based upon node labels is planned for future releases)
* with a subset of the components
* to use some components that have previously deployed somewhere, e.g. as a
  shared service

The resulting Acumos platform is illustrated in the following two figures, the
first representing the overall architecture, and the second the architecture of
the MLWB (Machine-Learning Workbench) subsystem.

Deploying the Platform, For the Impatient (TL;DR)
=================================================

NOTICE:

* this process will remove/install software on your host, and configure
  it e.g. firewall and security rules. Only execute this process if you understand
  the implications or are executing the process in a VM/host that you can easily
  re-create.
* by default, the Acumos platform is deployed with service exposure options
  typical for development environments. Production environments and especially
  public environments will need additional planning and restrictions on exposed
  services, that otherwise could expose your host to security risks. FOR TEST
  PURPOSES ONLY

Docker Based Deployment
-----------------------

NOTE: Not all Acumos features will work as expected under docker, so those will
not be deployed. Examples include the new services in support of model training.

To deploy the components that do work under docker, follow the instructions in
the sections below.

Prerequisites for Docker Based Deployment
.........................................

Prerequisites for docker based deployment:

* Deployment is supported only on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), Bionic (18.04), or
  Centos 7 hosts
* All hostnames or FQDNs specified in environment files must be DNS-resolvable
  (entries in /etc/hosts or in an actual DNS server)
* User running this script

  * has sudo privileges
  * has installed docker per system-integration/tools/setup_docker.sh
  * has added themselves to the docker group (sudo usermod -aG docker $USER),
    and re-logged-in to activate docker group membership
  * if deploying in preparation for use by a non-sudo user, has created the
    user account (sudo useradd -m <user>)
  * has cloned or otherwise provided the system-integration repo, in the
    user's home folder
  * has customized or created as needed

    * the main environment file system-integration/AIO/acumos-env
    * ELK-stack environment: see
      system-integration/charts/elk-stack/setup_elk_env.sh as a guide to what
      environment values can be customized. Customize the default values in
      that script, by changing the values after ':-" e.g. to change "true" to
      "false" replace the first line below with the second

      * export ACUMOS_DEPLOY_METRICBEAT="${ACUMOS_DEPLOY_METRICBEAT:-true}"
      * export ACUMOS_DEPLOY_METRICBEAT="${ACUMOS_DEPLOY_METRICBEAT:-false}"

    * MariaDB: as for the ELK_stack, customize
      system-integration/charts/mariadb/setup_mariadb_env.sh

Deploying for Yourself, as a Host Admin (sudo user)
...................................................

NOTE: If you are deploying into an Azure-based VM, pay attention to this
special configuration need for the docker-engine; update the acumos_env.sh
(in system-integration/AIO) script to set the ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER flag to
"false", which will ensure that the docker-dind service is not installed.
Docker-dind has known issues under Azure.

  .. code-block:: bash

    export ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER=false
  ..

If deploying the platform for yourself, run these commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd system-integration/AIO/
    bash setup_prereqs.sh docker <domain> $USER 2>&1 | tee aio_deploy.log
    bash oneclick_deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee -a aio_deploy.log
  ..

  * where:

    * <domain> is the name you want to use for the Acumos portal. This can be a
      hostname or FQDN.

  * The commands above include saving of the detailed deployment actions to a
    log file 'deploy.txt'. This can be helpful in getting support from the
    Acumos project team, to overcome issues you might encounter. If you don't
    want to save the log, just leave out the part of the commands above that
    starts with the 'pipe' ('|').


Preparing as a Host Admin, with Platform Deployment as a Normal User
....................................................................

If a Host Admin needs to run the privileged-user steps for a normal user that
will take it from there:

* NOTE: If you are deploying into an Azure-based VM, pay attention to this
  special configuration need for the docker-engine; update the acumos_env.sh
  (in system-integration/AIO) script to set the ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER flag to
  "false", which will ensure that the docker-dind service is not installed.
  Docker-dind has known issues under Azure.

  .. code-block:: bash

    export ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER=false
  ..

* As the Host Admin, run these commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd system-integration/AIO/
    bash setup_prereqs.sh docker <domain> <user> 2>&1 | tee aio_deploy.log
  ..

  * where:

    * <domain> is the name you want to use for the Acumos portal. This can be a
      hostname or FQDN.
    * <user> use the normal user's account name on the host

* As the normal user, run this command

  .. code-block:: bash

    bash oneclick_deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee -a aio_deploy.log
  ..

* As described above, if you don't need to save the deploy logs, leave out the
  the part of the commands above that starts with the 'pipe' ('|').


When Deployment is Complete
...........................

When deployment has completed, you should see a success message with a set of
URLs to access the various platform services. You can also view the file
"acumos.url" which will be in the system-integration/AIO folder (example below)

.. code-block:: bash

   You can access the Acumos portal and other services at the URLs below,
   assuming hostname "acumos.example.com" is resolvable from your workstation:

   Portal: https://acumos.example.com
   Common Data Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/ccds/swagger-ui.html
   Portal Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/api/swagger-ui.html
   Onboarding Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/onboarding-app/swagger-ui.html
   Kibana: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30561/app/kibana
   Nexus: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30881

By default, the platform is not configured to require email confirmation of
new accounts, so you can create a new account directly on the Portal home. To
create an account with the Admin role (needed for various platform admin
functions), use the create_user.sh script in the system-integration/tests folder

Kubernetes Based Deployment
---------------------------

The process below will support deployment under either a generic kubernetes
distribution, or the OpenShift kubernetes distribution. The scripts will detect
which distribution is installed and deploy per the requirements of that
distribution.

Deploying as a Privileged (sudo) User
.....................................

This process is for a user that wants to execute all steps in the deployment
process using their host account. To deploy the Acumos platform with the default
options, as a user on a linux host with at least 16GB RAM and admin (sudo)
permission, follow the process below.

* clone the system-integration repo

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://gerrit.acumos.org/r/system-integration
  ..

* using bash, check if the user is part of the docker group, and add if not

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ if [[ "$(id -nG "$USER" | grep docker)" == "" ]]; then sudo usermod -aG docker $USER; fi
  ..

  * if you see "usermod: group 'docker' does not exist", install docker (e.g.
    using setup_docker.sh in the system-integration/tools folder) and run the
    command above again. Once you do not see the message above, logout and re-login.

* execute the following command to install/configure prerequisites, including
  k8s, MariaDB, and the ELK stack, using your user account, and the hostname or
  domain name you will use to access the deployed platform.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ bash system-integration/AIO/acumos_k8s_prep.sh $USER <domain> 2>&1 | tee aio_prep.log
  ..

* When you see "Prerequisites setup is complete." as the result of the
  command above, execute the following commands to complete platform setup

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd system-integration/AIO
    $ bash oneclick_deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee aio_deploy.log
  ..

* As described above, if you don't need to save the deploy logs, leave out the
  the part of the commands above that starts with the 'pipe' ('|').

When deployment has completed, you should see a success message with a set of
URLs to access the various platform services. You can also view the file
"acumos.url" which will be in the system-integration/AIO folder (example below)

.. code-block:: bash

   You can access the Acumos portal and other services at the URLs below,
   assuming hostname "acumos.example.com" is resolvable from your workstation:

   Portal: https://acumos.example.com
   Common Data Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/ccds/swagger-ui.html
   Portal Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/api/swagger-ui.html
   Onboarding Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/onboarding-app/swagger-ui.html
   Kibana: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30561/app/kibana
   Nexus: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30881

By default, the platform is not configured to require email confirmation of
new accounts, so you can create a new account directly on the Portal home. To
create an account with the Admin role (needed for various platform admin
functions), use the create_user.sh script in the system-integration/tests folder

Preparation by Host Admin with Platform Deployment by Normal (non-sudo) User
............................................................................

This process is for a host Admin (sudo user) to prepare the host for a normal
(non-sudo) user that will complete the platform deployment, under their account.

* Admin clones the system-integration repo

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://gerrit.acumos.org/r/system-integration
  ..

* Admin ensures their user account is part of the docker group
* Admin executes the following command to install/configure prerequisites,
  including k8s, MariaDB, and the ELK stack, using their account. <user> in this
  case is the username of the normal user that will complete the deployment.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ bash system-integration/AIO/acumos_k8s_prep.sh <user> <domain> 2>&1 | tee aio_prep.log
  ..

* When prerequisites setup is complete, the Admin copies the resulting
  environment files and system-integration clone to the user account, e.g.

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo cp -r acumos /home/<user>/.
    sudo chown <user>:<user> /home/<user>/acumos
    sudo cp -r system-integration /home/<user>/.
    sudo chown <user>:<user> /home/<user>/system-integration

* The user executes the following commands to complete platform setup

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd system-integration/AIO
    $ bash oneclick_deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee aio_deploy.log
  ..

* As described above, if you don't need to save the deploy logs, leave out the
  the part of the commands above that starts with the 'pipe' ('|').

When deployment has completed, you should see a success message with a set of
URLs to access the various platform services. You can also view the file
"acumos.url" which will be in the system-integration/AIO folder (example below)

.. code-block:: bash

   You can access the Acumos portal and other services at the URLs below,
   assuming hostname "acumos.example.com" is resolvable from your workstation:

   Portal: https://acumos.example.com
   Common Data Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/ccds/swagger-ui.html
   Portal Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/api/swagger-ui.html
   Onboarding Service Swagger UI: https://acumos.example.com/onboarding-app/swagger-ui.html
   Kibana: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30561/app/kibana
   Nexus: http://<IP address of acumos.example.com>:30881

By default, the platform is not configured to require email confirmation of
new accounts, so you can create a new account directly on the Portal home. To
create an account with the Admin role (needed for various platform admin
functions), use the create_user.sh script in the system-integration/tests folder

Release Scope
=============

Current Release (Boreas)
------------------------

The `Acumos wiki <https://wiki.acumos.org/display/OAM/System+Integration>`_
describes the principle goals and related deployment scenarios supported by the
AIO toolset, and regularly verified in testing.

What's included in the AIO tools
................................

In system-integration repo folder AIO:

* acumos_k8s_prep.sh: Script to be used by a host admin (a user with privilege
  to install applications and configure the host) to prepare a host for a normal
  user to later deploy/manage the Acumos platform there, under a generic k8s
  cluster.
* setup_prereqs.sh: Prerequisite setup script for AIO deployment of the
  Acumos platform. Intended to support users who do not have sudo permission, to
  have a host admin (sudo user) run this script in advance for them. Used by
  acumos_k8s_prep.sh and other target environment support scripts.
* oneclick_deploy.sh: the main script that kicks off the deployment, to setup
  an AIO instance of Acumos under a docker or kubernetes environment. Used by
  acumos_k8s_deploy.sh, or by users to initiate Acumos platform deployment.
* acumos_env.sh: environment setup script that is customized as new
  environment parameters get generated (e.g. passwords). Used by various
  scripts in this toolset, to set shell environment variables that they need.

Deployment Step-by-Step Guide
=============================

The steps in this process are illustrated by the following figure. Note this
figure refers to kubernetes, but the same basic process applies for docker.

Prerequisites for each step are described for the step, under
`Pre-Arrangement of Ingress Certs`_, `Install Host Preparation by Admin`_, and
`Platform Deployment`_.

1) Host Admin clones the system-integration repo, or uses a local/customized
   clone.
2) Host Admin customizes the environment files and/or certs as desired, per
   `Pre-Arrangement of Ingress Certs`_
3) The Admin runs the applicable host preparation script as described in
   `Install Host Preparation by Admin`_
4) The user (Admin, if installing for their self) further updates the
   environment files and certs as desired, per `Platform Deployment`_
5) The user deploys the rest of the platform components via script
   'oneclick_deploy.sh', per `Platform Deployment`_

   :width: 100 %

Pre-Arrangement of Ingress Certs
--------------------------------

If you deploy the AIO platform often or in multiple test environments, you may
find it useful to pre-arrange the ingress certs that will be used to access the
platform(s), either using commercial cert providers, or the self-signed cert
tools provided in the system-integration repo. This allows you and users for
example to use web browser tools to trust self-signed certs, avoiding browser
warnings.

Creating a Self-Signed Cert
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Acumos tool supporting creation of self-signed certs is in
system-integration/AIO/certs/setup_certs.sh. An example is given below, showing
how to select the parameters for setting up a cert and related files that are
usable on multiple hosts, by hostname/domain and IP address:

* This script is invoked as:

.. code-block:: bash

  bash setup_certs.sh <name> <subject-name> ["alt-names"] ["alt-ips"]
..

Where:

* name: name prefix to use in the generated files (e.g. acumos)
* subject-name: primary domain name to associate
* alt-names: quoted, space-delimited set of alternate names
* alt-ips: quoted, space-delimited set of alternate IP addresses

as in the example:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd system-integration/AIO/certs
  bash setup-certs.sh acumos acumos \
    "test01 test02 test03 acumos-test04.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com" \
    "10.1.0.2 10.1.0.3 10.1.0.4 10.1.0.5"
..

This will generate the following files:

* acumos-ca.key: self-signed CA private key
* acumos-ca.crt: self-signed CA certificate
* acumos.key: server cert private key
* acumos.crt: server cert
* acumos-keystore.p12: PKCS12 format keystore with server cert
* acumos-truststore.jks: JKS format truststore with CA cert
* cert_env.sh: environment file with the related passwords

Using Commercial Certs
++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: the process below has not been verified. If you need to following this
process and encounter issues, reach out to the
`Acumos Community mail list <https://lists.lfai.foundation/g/acumosai-community>`_
for help.

To use commercial certs with the Acumos AIO platform, follow these steps:

* place the server cert and private key in folder system-integration/AIO/certs
* update related values in system-integration/AIO/acumos_env.sh and put these
  commands into a file system-integration/AIO/cert_env.sh

  * export ACUMOS_CERT_PREFIX=<prefix you want to use for your keystore/truststore
  * export ACUMOS_CERT=<name of the server cert file)
  * export ACUMOS_CERT_KEY=<name of the server cert private key file>
  * export ACUMOS_CERT_KEY_PASSWORD=<passphrase for the cert private key>

* run the commands below, which create the keystore and truststore for Acumos

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd system-integration/AIO/certs
    source cert_env.sh
    KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$(uuidgen)
    echo "export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" >>cert_env.sh
    openssl pkcs12 -export \
      -in $ACUMOS_CERT \
      -inkey $ACUMOS_CERT_KEY \
      -passin pass:$CERT_KEY_PASSWORD \
      -certfile $ACUMOS_CERT \
      -out $ACUMOS_CERT_PREFIX-keystore.p12 \
      -passout pass:$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

    TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=$(uuidgen)
    echo "export TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=$TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD" >>cert_env.sh
    keytool -import \
      -file $ACUMOS_CERT \
      -alias $ACUMOS_CERT_PREFIX-ca \
      -keystore $ACUMOS_CERT_PREFIX-truststore.jks \
      -storepass $TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD -noprompt

  ..

Install Host Preparation by Admin
---------------------------------

NOTE: If you are deploying under k8s into an Azure-based VM, pay attention to the
special configuration need for the docker-engine, as described below.

Prerequisites:

* Ubuntu Xenial/Bionic or Centos 7 server
* All hostnames specified in acumos_env.sh must be DNS-resolvable on all hosts
  (entries in /etc/hosts or in an actual DNS server)
* For deployments behind proxies, set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY in acumos_env.sh
* Admin user running this script has:

  * Installed docker per system-integration/tools/setup_docker.sh
  * Added themselves to the docker group (sudo usermod -aG docker $USER)
  * Logged out and back in, to activate docker group membership

* Initial basic setup (manual)

  * If you are an Admin and deploying the platform for a normal user, assuming
    the non-sudo user is "acumos"

    .. code-block:: bash

      sudo useradd -m acumos
    ..

This process prepares the host with prerequisites that normal users do not have
permission to arrange. This includes:

* installing software packages
* configuring host settings
* creating folders for host-mapped volumes

The Admin user will follow this process:

* 'install root folder' refers to the Admin user's home folder. Installation
  in other root folders is a work in progress, and not yet fully verified.
* create in the install root folder a subfolder "acumos" and folders "env",
  "logs", "certs" under it.
* in the install root folder, clone the system-integration repo (branch, tag,
  commit, or master), and make any desired updates to it (e.g. checkout a
  specific patch)
* If you are deploying the platform under k8s in an Azure VM, update acumos_env.sh
  (in system-integration/AIO) script to set the ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER flag to
  "false", which will ensure that the docker-dind service is not installed.
  Docker-dind has known issues under Azure.

  .. code-block:: bash

    export ACUMOS_DEPLOY_DOCKER=false
  ..

* If you are deploying under docker, run the command

.. code-block:: bash

  bash setup_prereqs.sh <under> <domain> <user>
..

  * under: docker (install prereqs for docker or k8s based deployment)
  * domain: FQDN of platform
  * user: user that will be completing Acumos platform setup via
          oneclick_deploy.sh (if installing for yourself, use $USER)


* If you are deploying under k8s, run the command

  .. code-block:: bash

    bash system-integration/AIO/acumos_k8s_prep.sh <user> <domain>
  ..

  * user: non-sudo user account (use $USER if deploying for yourself)
  * domain: domain name of Acumos platorm (resolves to this host)

When the process is complete, acumos_k8s_prep.sh will have copied the
updated system-integration clone and environment files to the platform
deployment user's home folder. If you are deploying the platform for yourself,
proceed to the next section. If preparing the platform for a normal user,
the user should execute the process in the next section.

Platform Deployment
-------------------

The script supporting this step is system-integration/AIO/oneclick_deploy.sh.

Prerequisites:

* User workstation is Ubuntu Xenial/Bionic, Centos 7, or MacOS
* acumos_k8s_prep.sh (for k8s based deploy) or setup_prereqs.sh (for docker
  based deploy) run by a sudo user
* As setup by those scripts, a user home folder "acumos" with subfolders "env",
  "logs", and "certs". These folders are created by the prerequisites scripts
  principally as a backup to the environment files under system-integration/AIO.

This process deploys the Acumos platform with the options selectable by the
user, e.g.

* any option selectable through the environment files, which can be customized
  in the backup folder "acumos/env" or directly in the system-integration clone
  under:

  * ~/system-integration/AIO/acumos/env/acumos_env.sh
  * ~/system-integration/AIO/acumos/env/mariadb_env.sh
  * ~/system-integration/AIO/acumos/env/elk_env.sh
  * ~/system-integration/AIO/mlwb/mlwb_env.sh
  * NOTE

    * for k8s based deployments, since acumos_k8s_prep.sh by default will have
      deployed MariaDB and the ELK stack core, do not modify the related
      environment values unless you disabled deployment of MariaDb or ELK by
      setting ACUMOS_DEPLOY_MARIADB and/or ACUMOS_DEPLOY_ELK to 'false' in acumos_env.sh
    * a detailed description of the customizable environment values is not
      provided here, but the Acumos community can assist you with any support
      questions you may have via the
      `Acumos Community mail list <https://lists.lfai.foundation/g/acumosai-community>`_

* use of pre-created certs per `Pre-Arrangement of Ingress Certs`_

* if you updated the environment files or certificates under ~/acumos, prior
  to running the deployment command below, copy those updates into the
  system-integration clone:

  * cp ~/acumos/env/* ~/system-integration/AIO/.
  * cp ~/acumos/certs/* ~/system-integration/AIO/certs/.

To deploy the rest of the platform components, run the commands:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/system-integration/AIO
    bash oneclick_deploy.sh
  ..

When the process is complete, you will see a set of URLs to the main platform
component/UI features, as described above.

Updating Configuration and Components
-------------------------------------

Changes to the configuration can be applied as described in the previous section.
Note that if you are making changes to the configuration of a deployed platform,
some changes may break some aspects of the platform, so be careful.

The most commonly updated configuration items include:

* in acumos_env.sh

  * component versions
  * component hosts and ports, e.g. for reuse of previously deployed components,
    e.g. a shared docker-engine, docker registry, MariaDB, Nexus, or ELK stack service
  * component credentials (user and/or password)
  * ports, to avoid conflict with other deployments in the same environment
  * Nexus repo details
  * HTTP proxy
  * CDS (Common Dataservice) database version
  * model onboarding tokenmode
  * operator ID
  * kubernetes namespace
  * Persistent Volume options

* docker-compose templates in AIO/docker/acumos or kubernetes templates in
  AIO/kubernetes

  * Note: make sure the template modifications are compatible with previously
    deployed components, and the version of the related Acumos component you
    are deploying/re-deploying

Stopping, Restarting, Redeploying
---------------------------------

Note: the following sections assume that you have deployed the Acumos platform
from the system-integration folder in your user home directory, i.e. "~/".

Docker-Based Deployments
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To stop components running under docker and remove the containers, execute the
following commands from the "docker" folder related to the type of component,
referencing the related docker-compose yaml file as "<yml>":

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/system-integration/<docker folder>
  source ~/system-integration/AIO/acumos_env.sh
  docker-compose -f acumos/<yml> down
..

The related docker folders are:

* AIO/docker, for Acumos core components azure-client, common-data-svc,
  dsce (AcuCompose), federation, kubernetes-client, microservice-generation,
  onboarding, portal-be, portal-fe, sv-scanning
* AIO/docker-proxy/docker, for the docker-proxy core component
* AIO/mlwb/docker, for the MLWB components
* AIO/nexus/docker, for nexus
* AIO/mariadb/docker, for mariadb
* AIO/kong/docker, for kong
* AIO/elk-stack/docker, for the core ELK-stack components elasticsearch,
  logstash, kibana
* AIO/beats/docker, for the "beats" components filebeat, metricbeat

To restart these components, e.g. after updating the related configuration files,
issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/system-integration/<docker folder>
  source ~/system-integration/AIO/acumos_env.sh
  docker-compose -f acumos/<yml> up -d --build
..

If you want to automatically stop and redeploy the components in one command:

* for Acumos core components (azure-client-service, cds-service, dsce-service,
  federation-service, kubernetes-client-service, msg-service, onboarding-service,
  portal-be-service, portal-fe-service, sv-scanning-service)

  .. code-block:: bash

    bash ~/system-integration/AIO/redeploy_component.sh <component>
  ..

* for the other components, a specific redeployment script is provided in the
  related folder (docker-proxy, mlwb, nexus, mariadb, kong, elk-stack, beats)

  .. code-block:: bash

    bash ~/system-integration/AIO/<folder>/setup_*.sh  ~/system-integration/AIO/
  ..

Kubernetes-Based Deployments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Because kubernetes-based components may depend upon a variety of other
kubernetes resources specific to them or shared with other components (e.g.
configmaps, secrets, PVCs), simply redeploying the specific
components after any required configuration updates is recommended.

The configuration files specific the components are generally under a subfolder
"kubernetes", and are specific to the type of resource (e.g. service, deployment,
configmap, secret, PVC, etc). Once you have updated these as needed, you can'
redeploy the component and any resources specific to it (not shared) via the
command:

* for core components under AIO/kubernetes/deployment, using the component names
  per the "app:" value in the related deployment template (azure-client, cds,
  dsce, federation, kubernetes-client, msg, onboarding, portal-be, portal-fe,
  sv-scanning):

  .. code-block:: bash

    bash ~/system-integration/AIO/redeploy_component.sh <component>
  ..

* for the other components, running the related "setup_*.sh" command as described
  for docker

If you just need to stop a component, use the following command and reference the
related "app" label:


.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl delete deployment -n acumos -l app=<app>
..

You can see all the component-related "app" labels via the command:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get deployment -n acumos -o wide
..

After stopping the component, you can redeploy it as needed using the methods
described above.

Logs Location
=============

Logs are easily accessible on the AIO host under /mnt/<ACUMOS_NAMESPACE>/logs
directory ('<ACUMOS_NAMESPACE>' is by default 'acumos'). That directory is
mounted by most Acumos components as their log directory.
