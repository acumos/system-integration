### Kubernetes Dashboard

> NOTE:  the Kubernetes Dashboard has been added to the K8s/kind installation - more information forthcoming.

A Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface which is used to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot the applications, and manage the cluster itself along with its attendant resources.

### Uses of Kubernetes Dashboard

* To get an overview of applications running on your cluster.
* To create or modify the individual Kubernetes resources for example Deployments, Jobs, etc.
* It provides the information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster, and on any errors that may have occurred.
