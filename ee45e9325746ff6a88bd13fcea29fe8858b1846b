      "message": "Chris,\nI need this to implement the https secure onboarding for now. I have the real certificates for Research-DEV and Production, which I want to make sure they work and see if Ken and testing team deploy without errors. It could be merged with the overall docker-compose file or not since this has to run only ones when the system is being setup and should work for subsequent Acumos application updates. I will leave it up to you and Bryan to make that call.",
